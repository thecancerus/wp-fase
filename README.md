#WP-FASE

##(WordPress Filter and Action Syntax Extractor)

This package is designed to traverse and arbitrary folder and find all instances of WordPress `add_action`, `add_filter`, `apply_filters`, `do_action`, and `do_action_ref_array` with HTML, JSON or plain text output. Other output format filters can be programmed and are easily added.

Output is directed to the console and should be redirected for capturing. Future versions will have more output options.

This project is very much "alpha" and still in very early development.

**Current Version:** 0.17 (2014-01-23)

- HTML output filter with JavaScript / Ajax navigation
